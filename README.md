Flight Spanners Project Overview

The spanner is the authorized technical person to accompany the aircraft flights so he could
release the aircraft to service and rectify any defects at the flight destination.
There are a number of flights required to be equally distributed between these spanners by 
a staff member known as organizer.
The organizer receives unprocessed flight records (without spanners), then the organizer convert 
it to a processed flight records (by assigning a spanner for each unprocessed record), 
after that he marks them as settled record. The settled record is the confirmed processed 
record, and only the settled record could be part of the balance calculation and could be 
viewed by spanners.
These unprocessed flights will not have similar spanner exertion. Some of the flights are 
distinctive and perfect (e.g.: short flight) and some are imperfect (e.g.: long flight).
All of these flights monetarily equivalent, means that the long and short flight payed with 
the same money.

The main purposes of this web project as follows:-
-  Help the organizer to equally distribute the flights between spanners of his group by first
    manually distribute the flights (by the organizer) to the spanners and then the application
    calculate the balance of each spanner according to balance equation and from the calculated
    balance the application give the organizer the deserved flights of each spanner. 
-  Using a number of constants in the balance equation, which is the tool that simulate the 
    unequal flights conditions to try to overcome the unfair monetarily issue.
-  Allow the spanners to monitor their record of flights, his deserved flights, his flight in
    formation, and optionally to monitor his group of spanners record to push his organizer 
    to be fair with the distribution. All of these through the internet from anywhere all 
    over the world.
-  If time permits for the current phase: a notification mechanism will be developed to 
    notify the spanners by email about their deserved flights.
-  In future version the organizer could override the default values of constants using 
    JSON file for each group.
-  Currently the admin is the developer of the project, so no UI required for Admin, but in 
    the future versions there will be UI for the admin.
-  In the future versions of the application there would be additional option to allow for 
    automatic flights distribution using an AI algorithm.

The application will be a web project type, developing uses ASP.Net core 2.1 for the 
server side and HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the front end side.
The database engine would be SQL Server 2017.
